# Contributing to Eclipse

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the project! I welcome contributions of all kinds — from fixing random bugs to implementing new features. Please read these guidelines carefully before submitting your work.


## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**: Click the **Fork** button in the top‑right corner of the [Eclipse repository page](https://github.com/CatsT0day/CAPI) to create your own copy.
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CatsT0day/Eclipse
   cd Eclipse
```
3. **Set up the upstream remote to keep your fork in sync with the original repository:**
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/CatsT0day/CAPI
```
## Branching Strategy
Never work directly on the main branch.

Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-new-command
```
## or
```bash
git checkout -b bugfix/fix-null-pointer
```
## Keep branches focused: one branch = one task.
Before starting new work, update your main branch:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```
## Code Style & Guidelines
 **Please, Follow the existing code style of the project. (wanna add command? For any bukkit feeatures, create Eclipse ones, so it will be a lot easier to update them)
  Before contributing look at the code, when you understand it you can contribute, if you won't follow I will not accept your request**
 

 *****Happy coding! We look forward to seeing your contributions.*****
